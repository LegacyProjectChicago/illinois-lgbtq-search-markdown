On behalf of the entire team at the **Illinois Inclusive Curriculum Advisory Council** – the **Legacy Project, Equality Illinois, 
Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago**, and **Illinois Safe Schools Alliance** – you are invited to explore the new search portal 
for **LGBTQ-Inclusive Education tools**. 

Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer people have made significant contributions to human history. Indeed, there is no aspect of 
humanity’s story that does not have an LGBTQ person attached to it in some way. Though the details of their lives have been, in most cases, redacted – or
overlooked entirely – the impact they have had has been lasting and deserves exploration in the fullest, most honest way possible. 
The new LGBTQ-Inclusive Curriculum Law, signed into law by Governor J.B. Pritzker in August 2019, offers an opportunity to take a 
refreshingly new look at the subjects studied in every Illinois public school. 

**You and your students are in for an eye-opening treat...**
