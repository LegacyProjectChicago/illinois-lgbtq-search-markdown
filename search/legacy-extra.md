  Each Lesson Plan is based on James Banks’s multicultural education
  model; which approaches teaching by utilizing four progressing levels of
  exercises and activities predicated on the cognitive retention and
  analytical capabilities of the students being taught. We have adapted
  this model as follows:

  * **LEVEL 1: Contributions Approach** [Appropriate for Grades 3
    through 5]
  * **LEVEL 2: Additive Approach** [Appropriate for Grades 5 through 8]

  * **LEVEL 3: Transformational Approach** [Appropriate for Grades 8
    through 11]
  * **LEVEL 4: Social Action Approach** [Appropriate for Grades 10
    through 12]
  These correlations to Grade Level are fungible; ultimately, it is up to
  each teacher to determine which collection of exercises (or combination
  thereof) seem most appropriate for their students. We also encourage
  teachers to use the suggested exercises and activities in these lesson
  plans as a jumping-off point for whatever works best for you in the
  classroom. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to
  incorporate these amazing LGBTQ lives and stories and achievements into
  your existing curriculum… thereby by rendering what you already teach to
  be LGBTQ-Inclusive.

  The age-appropriate lesson plans created by the Legacy Project look at
  these lives and achievements through a corrective lens that allows for a
  broader understanding of human diversity; each reviews and examines the
  experiences and motivations which compelled LGBTQ figures to make those
  choices which impacted history and/or culture. By encouraging young
  people to think about history in terms of the people and the choices
  which drive it, we can give them tools to become critical thinkers.
