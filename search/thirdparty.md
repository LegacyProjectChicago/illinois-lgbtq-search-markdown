### 2nd- and 3rd-Party Proprietary Lesson Plans
  This website will soon also feature lesson plans, activities, and
  exercises created by independent contributors to the Illinois Inclusive
  Curriculum effort, as well as tools accessible through similar sites.
  All these efforts are focused on bringing to Illinois educators a
  variety of ways to address not only LGBTQ contributions to history and
  culture, but to also explore the very concepts of gender, sexuality,
  identity, and variant family structure â€“ ideal for younger students.
