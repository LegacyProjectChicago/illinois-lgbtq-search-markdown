  Each of these efforts has been analyzed in the same way the Legacy
  Project has evaluated its own work. By studying the Illinois Education
  Codes – both their thematic intent as well as the particular grades to
  which each is aligned – we have been able to map out how these lesson
  plans, activities, exercises and multimedia tools intersect with these
  standards, the various school subjects being taught, and the overarching
  goals of a multicultural education in the State of Illinois.

  Each of these packets consists of multiple elements and contain links to
  download and/or view resources you can bring into the classroom to
  broaden your students’ understanding of human diversity and the value of
  different perspectives when it comes to solving the problems facing a
  complex society made up of all sorts of people. Follow the instructions
  contained within each.
